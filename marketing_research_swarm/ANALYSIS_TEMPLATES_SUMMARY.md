## üìä **Usage Examples**

```bash
# Run sales forecasting analysis
python src/marketing_research_swarm/main.py --type sales_forecast

# Run brand performance analysis  
python src/marketing_research_swarm/main.py --type brand_performance

# Run ROI analysis
python src/marketing_research_swarm/main.py --type roi_analysis

# Run comprehensive analysis (all agents/tasks)
python src/marketing_research_swarm/main.py --type comprehensive
```

## üîß **Configuration Updates**

Updated `main.py` to use specific configurations:

```python
if analysis_type == "sales_forecast":
    agents_config_path = 'src/marketing_research_swarm/config/agents_sales_forecast.yaml'
    tasks_config_path = 'src/marketing_research_swarm/config/tasks_sales_forecast.yaml'
    
elif analysis_type == "brand_performance":
    agents_config_path = 'src/marketing_research_swarm/config/agents_brand_performance.yaml'
    tasks_config_path = 'src/marketing_research_swarm/config/tasks_brand_performance.yaml'
    
elif analysis_type == "roi_analysis":
    agents_config_path = 'src/marketing_research_swarm/config/agents_roi_analysis.yaml'
    tasks_config_path = 'src/marketing_research_swarm/config/tasks_roi_analysis.yaml'
```

## üìÅ **Files Created**

1. `src/marketing_research_swarm/config/agents_sales_forecast.yaml`
2. `src/marketing_research_swarm/config/tasks_sales_forecast.yaml`
3. `src/marketing_research_swarm/config/agents_brand_performance.yaml`
4. `src/marketing_research_swarm/config/tasks_brand_performance.yaml`

## üéØ **Benefits**

- **Focused Analysis**: Each type runs only relevant agents and tasks
- **Optimized Performance**: Faster execution with targeted workflows
- **Cost Efficiency**: Only pay for tokens used by relevant agents
- **Clear Outputs**: Specialized reports for each analysis type
- **Easy Maintenance**: Separate configurations for each analysis type

## üöÄ **Next Steps**

1. **Test all analysis types** to ensure proper functionality
2. **Validate token tracking** works across all configurations
3. **Optimize agent/task combinations** based on performance
4. **Add more specialized tools** for specific analysis types if needed

The system now supports **4 distinct analysis modes**:
- `comprehensive` - Full analysis with all agents
- `roi_analysis` - ROI and budget optimization focus
- `sales_forecast` - Forecasting and trend analysis focus  
- `brand_performance` - Brand health and competitive analysis focus
