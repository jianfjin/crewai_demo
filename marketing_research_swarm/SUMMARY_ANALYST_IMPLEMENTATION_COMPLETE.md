## üéõÔ∏è **Dashboard Integration Ready**

### **‚úÖ Dashboard Enhancement Points**:

**1. Import Summary Agent**:
```python
from src.marketing_research_swarm.langgraph_workflow.enhanced_agents import (
    # ... other agents ...
    summary_analyst
)
```

**2. Add to Workflow Graph**:
```python
# Add summary analyst as final node
workflow.add_node("summary_analyst", summary_analyst)

# Connect all agents to summary analyst
for agent in selected_agents:
    workflow.add_edge(agent, "summary_analyst")
```

**3. Display Final Report**:
```python
# Show final report in dashboard
if final_state.get("final_report"):
    st.markdown("## üìä Executive Summary Report")
    st.markdown(final_state["final_report"])
    
    # Show metadata
    if final_state.get("report_metadata"):
        metadata = final_state["report_metadata"]
        st.info(f"Generated: {metadata['generated_at']}")
        st.info(f"Components Analyzed: {metadata['components_analyzed']}")
```
