#### **Slide 3: The Opportunity: Beyond Traditional Marketing Research**

*   **The Problem:**
    *   Traditional market research is often slow, manual, and costly.
    *   Data is vast and siloed (social media, sales figures, reports, web analytics).
    *   Synthesizing this data into a single, actionable narrative is a major challenge.
*   **Our Solution:**
    *   An autonomous system of specialized AI agents that collaborate to perform complex research tasks.
    *   It mimics a human research team, but operates at machine speed and scale.
    *   **Goal:** Move from data reporting to predictive and prescriptive insights.

#### **Slide 4: Core Concept 1: What is an AI Agent?**

*   **Definition:** An AI system that uses a Large Language Model (LLM) as its core reasoning engine to perceive its environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve a goal.
*   **Key Components:**
    *   **LLM (The Brain):** For reasoning, planning, and natural language understanding (e.g., GPT-4, Gemini).
    *   **Tools (The Hands):** Functions the agent can call to interact with the world (e.g., web search, code execution, database queries).
    *   **Memory (The Notebook):** Short-term and long-term storage to maintain context and learn from past interactions.

---

#### **Slide 5: Core Concept 1.1: Multi-Agent Systems**

*   **What is it?** A system where multiple agents work together, communicate, and delegate tasks to solve a problem more complex than any single agent could handle alone.
*   **Popular Frameworks:**
    *   **CrewAI:**
        *   **Analogy:** A well-defined corporate hierarchy.
        *   High-level, role-based framework. Easy to set up collaborative "crews".
        *   **Pro:** Fast prototyping, clear structure.
        *   **Con:** Can be rigid; less control over the workflow.
        *   **Used by:** PwC, AWS (for Bedrock Agents), and many startups for functions from marketing to internal automation.
    *   **LangGraph:**
        *   **Analogy:** A flexible, dynamic project team mapped on a whiteboard.
        *   Lower-level library for building stateful, graph-based agent workflows.
        *   **Pro:** Highly flexible, supports complex cycles and explicit state management.
        *   **Con:** Steeper learning curve.
        *   **Used by:** LinkedIn (for SQL bots), Uber (for code migration), Replit (for their dev copilot), and Elastic (for threat detection).
*   **Our Choice:** We chose **LangGraph** for its flexibility to model the complex, cyclical, and unpredictable nature of in-depth research.

#### **Slide 6: Core Concept 2: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**

*   **What is it?** A technique to make LLMs smarter and more reliable by connecting them to external knowledge bases.
*   **How it Works (Simple Flow):**
    1.  **Retrieve:** When asked a question, the system first searches a private knowledge base (e.g., vector database of company reports, sales data).
    2.  **Augment:** The relevant information found is added to the user's original prompt.
    3.  **Generate:** The LLM generates an answer based on both the original question and the retrieved data.
*   **Our Innovation: Self-Correcting RAG**
    *   Our system adds a validation loop. The RAG agent critiques the retrieved documents for relevance. If they are insufficient, it can re-query or even use a web search tool to find better information *before* generating the final answer. This drastically improves accuracy.

---

#### **Slide 7: Core Concept 3: Context Engineering**

*   **What is it?** The science of optimizing the information (the "context") fed to an LLM.
*   **Why it Matters:**
    *   **Cost:** LLM costs are based on token usage. Sending irrelevant data is expensive.
    *   **Performance:** LLMs have a finite "attention span" (context window). Filling it with noise degrades reasoning quality.
    *   **Accuracy:** The right context leads to the right answer.
*   **Key Techniques We Use:**
    *   **Context Pruning & Compression:** Summarizing long documents and conversations.
    *   **Shared State (Blackboard):** A central place for agents to share findings, avoiding redundant work.
    *   **Data Caching:** Storing the results of expensive operations (like data analysis) so they don't have to be run again.

    H -- Query Data --> K;
    G1 & G2 & G3 -- Use/Update --> L;
    I -- Final Report --> B;
    B -- Streams Results --> A;
```
*   **Flow Explanation:**
    1.  User submits a research query via the **React Dashboard**.
    2.  The **FastAPI backend** receives the query. The **RAG module** searches the **Knowledge Base** and not only retrieves data but also **recommends the best agents** for the task.
    3.  The **LangGraph Orchestrator** starts the workflow with the recommended agents and initial context.
    4.  Agents collaborate using a **Shared State (Blackboard)**, calling **Tools** to analyze data, and using a **Cache** to store intermediate results.
    5.  The final, synthesized report is passed back to the dashboard.

#### **Slide 9: Innovation 1: RAG-driven Agent Selection**

*   **The Problem:** In a complex system, how do you know which specialist (agent) to assign to a new task?
*   **Our Solution:** We treat our agents' descriptions and capabilities as a part of our knowledge base.
*   **How it works:**
    1.  A user asks: "Analyze the ROI of our latest marketing campaign for 'Fresh' beverages."
    2.  The RAG system searches its knowledge base. It finds documents related to "ROI analysis" and "Fresh beverages".
    3.  Simultaneously, it finds that the "Data Scientist Agent" and "BI Specialist Agent" have capabilities matching these keywords.
    4.  The system instantiates a workflow with these specific agents, providing them with the relevant documents from the start.
*   **Benefit:** This creates a dynamic, context-aware, and efficient team for every unique query.

#### **Slide 10: Innovation 2: Context Engineering in Action**

*   **Shared State (The Blackboard):**
    *   Instead of passing long chat histories between agents, they write key findings to a central blackboard. New agents can get up to speed instantly by reading the blackboard, saving tokens and time.
*   **Persistent Caching:**
    *   An agent runs a complex data analysis on `beverage_sales.csv`. The result (a chart and summary) is cached.
    *   If another agent (or a future query) needs the same analysis, the result is retrieved from the cache instantly, saving significant computation and token costs.
*   **Context Pruning & Isolation:**
    *   Each agent is given only the part of the context relevant to its specific task. The Data Scientist gets the raw data file path; the BI Specialist gets the summary and chart. This keeps the context for each agent clean and focused.
