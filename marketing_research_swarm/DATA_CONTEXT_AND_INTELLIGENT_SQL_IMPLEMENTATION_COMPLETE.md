- **Comprehensive Schema Analysis**: Automatically extracts column types, ranges, unique values, and data quality metrics
- **Data Preview Generation**: Provides sample rows and statistical summaries
- **Smart Context Prompts**: Generates formatted context information for LLM agents
- **Caching System**: Efficiently caches data context to avoid repeated loading

**Key Features:**
```python
# Automatic data context generation
data_context = {
    "schema": {...},           # Column types, ranges, unique values
    "preview": {...},          # Sample data rows
    "summary": {...},          # Statistical summaries
    "distinct_values": {...},  # Categorical value lists
    "data_quality": {...},     # Completeness metrics
    "suggested_queries": [...] # SQL query suggestions
}
```

#### **2. Enhanced Workflow Integration (`enhanced_workflow.py`)**
- **Automatic Data Loading**: Data context is loaded at workflow initialization
- **State Integration**: Data context is passed to all agents through workflow state
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback when data context is unavailable

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ All agents now understand the data structure before execution
- ‚úÖ Agents can make informed tool selections based on available columns
- ‚úÖ Improved accuracy in data analysis and recommendations

### **Phase 2: Intelligent SQL Generation**

#### **3. Intelligent SQL Generator (`intelligent_sql_generator.py`)**

- **Schema-Aware Generation**: SQL queries use actual column names and data types
- **Validation & Execution**: Automatically validates and executes generated SQL
- **Result Formatting**: Structures SQL results for easy analysis by other agents

**Key Features:**
```python
# Intelligent SQL generation with data context
sql_result = sql_generator.generate_sql_from_query(
    user_query="Which brand had the greatest customer loss?",
    data_source="beverage_sales"
)
# Returns: {"query": "SELECT...", "result": {...}, "explanation": "..."}
```

#### **4. Enhanced Reflective Report Summarizer**
- **Smart Query Detection**: Automatically identifies data-specific queries that benefit from SQL
- **Skip-to-SQL Logic**: Bypasses generic retry steps for data queries
- **Intelligent Retry Strategy**: Uses SQL generation as primary approach for relevant queries
- **Context-Aware Analysis**: Combines SQL results with agent analysis for comprehensive answers

**Improved Workflow:**
1. **Query Analysis**: Determines if query is data-specific
2. **Smart Routing**: Skips to intelligent SQL for relevant queries
3. **SQL Generation**: Creates context-aware SQL using LLM
4. **Result Integration**: Combines SQL results with agent analysis
5. **Quality Validation**: Reflects on answer relevance and retries if needed

### **Phase 3: Agent Enhancement**

#### **5. Enhanced Agent Prompts (`enhanced_agents.py`)**
- **Data Context Integration**: All agents receive comprehensive data schema information
- **Column Awareness**: Agents know available columns, types, and sample values
- **Smart Tool Selection**: Agents can choose tools based on actual data structure
- **Improved Recommendations**: Data-informed insights and suggestions

**Agent Prompt Enhancement:**
```
üìä DATA CONTEXT & SCHEMA AWARENESS:

Dataset Information:
- Rows: 15,000
- Columns: 16
- Data Quality: 98.5% complete

Key Columns Available:
- brand (object): 8 unique values | Examples: Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Red Bull
- total_revenue (float64): 15000 unique values | Range: 100.0 to 5000.0
- region (object): 5 unique values | Examples: North America, Europe, Asia Pacific
...

IMPORTANT: Use this data context to:
- Select tools that match available columns and data types
- Use correct column names in your analysis
- Understand data structure and relationships
- Make data-informed recommendations
```

## üéØ **Problem Resolution**

### **Before Implementation:**
‚ùå **Generic Analysis**: "I attempted to provide a specific answer... but was unable to generate a sufficiently relevant response"
‚ùå **Hardcoded SQL**: Predefined SQL templates that didn't match user queries
‚ùå **Agent Blindness**: Agents didn't know what data was available
‚ùå **Inefficient Retries**: Report summarizer went through all retry steps unnecessarily

### **After Implementation:**
‚úÖ **Specific Data-Driven Answers**: Direct SQL queries provide exact answers with real data
‚úÖ **Dynamic SQL Generation**: LLM creates custom SQL based on user query and data schema
‚úÖ **Data-Aware Agents**: All agents understand data structure and make informed decisions
‚úÖ **Smart Retry Logic**: Skip directly to SQL for data-specific queries

## üìä **Example: Query Processing Flow**

**User Query**: "Analyze brand performance to determine which experienced the greatest net loss of customers last quarter."

### **New Intelligent Flow:**

1. **Query Analysis** üéØ
   ```
   üéØ Query identified as data-specific: will skip to intelligent SQL
   Keywords detected: "which", "greatest", "brand", "performance", "quarter"
   ```

2. **Data Context Loading** üìä
   ```
   üìä Data context loaded: {'rows': 15000, 'columns': 16}
   Schema: brand, region, category, total_revenue, profit_margin, quarter, year...
   ```

3. **Intelligent SQL Generation** üß†
   ```sql
   -- Generated by LLM with full data context awareness
   WITH quarterly_revenue AS (
       SELECT 
           brand,
           CONCAT(year, '-Q', quarter) as period,
           SUM(total_revenue) as revenue
       FROM beverage_sales 
       GROUP BY brand, year, quarter
   ),
   revenue_changes AS (
       SELECT 
           brand,
           revenue,
           LAG(revenue) OVER (PARTITION BY brand ORDER BY period) as prev_revenue,
           (revenue - LAG(revenue) OVER (PARTITION BY brand ORDER BY period)) / 
           LAG(revenue) OVER (PARTITION BY brand ORDER BY period) * 100 as change_pct
       FROM quarterly_revenue
   )
   SELECT brand, AVG(change_pct) as avg_change_pct
   FROM revenue_changes 
   WHERE prev_revenue IS NOT NULL
   GROUP BY brand
   ORDER BY avg_change_pct ASC;
   ```

4. **Direct Data Results** üìà
   ```
   SQL Query Results:
   Row 1: {'brand': 'Monster Energy', 'avg_change_pct': -18.5}
   Row 2: {'brand': 'Red Bull', 'avg_change_pct': -12.3}
   Row 3: {'brand': 'Pepsi', 'avg_change_pct': -8.7}
   ...
   ```

5. **Intelligent Analysis** üí°
   ```
   Based on the direct SQL analysis, Monster Energy experienced the greatest net loss 
   of customers last quarter with an average revenue decline of 18.5%, followed by 
   Red Bull at 12.3% decline...
   ```

## üöÄ **Performance Benefits**
