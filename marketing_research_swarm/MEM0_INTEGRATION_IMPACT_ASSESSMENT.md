   ```
   Current: "Q4 shows increased sales"
   
   Enhanced: "Q4 shows 23% increase, consistent with historical holiday 
   patterns observed in 2022-2023, but 8% higher than typical seasonal 
   boost, suggesting additional factors like new product launches"
   ```

2. **Causal Analysis** 🔄
   - **Current**: Surface-level correlations
   - **With mem0**: Deep causal understanding from historical patterns
   - **Example**: "Revenue decline correlates with competitor launch timing, as seen in 3 previous similar scenarios"

3. **Predictive Insights** 🔮
   - **Current**: Basic forecasting
